                            <p>Dark chocolate, with its notable deep brown color, is the second most popular type of
                                chocolate. It is sometimes referred to as black or semisweet chocolate and is noticeably
                                less sweet than milk chocolate. In recent years, dark chocolate has surged in popularity
                                thanks to a number of articles being published about the health benefits.

                                Dark chocolate is fairly simple in composition. It is typically made from two
                                ingredients — chocolate liquor and sugar. Sometimes small amounts of vanilla and soy
                                lecithin (an emulsifier) are added. According to the FDA definition, dark chocolate must
                                contain at least 15% chocolate liquor but usually contains closer to about 50%. Most
                                high-quality, dark chocolate does not contain added dairy and can be a great
                                vegan-friendly chocolate. The lack of dairy and less sugar gives dark chocolate firmer
                                texture than milk chocolate or white chocolate. This is why a well-tempered piece of
                                dark chocolate will have a nice snap when broken in half.

                                The flavor profile of dark chocolate can vary widely based on the cocoa content of the
                                chocolate. It is often slightly-sweet and chocolatey, with notes of baked brownie, red
                                fruit, and brown spice (think cinnamon or allspice). Due to its chocolate-forward flavor
                                profile, dark chocolate is great for baking when your recipe needs a rich, chocolatey
                                flavor. We recommend trying these classic brownies or this decadent chocolate bourbon
                                maple pecan pie. Dark chocolate's widely-acclaimed health benefits make it a favorite
                                snack among health-conscious consumers. When properly stored, it has a shelf-life of
                                about 20 months.</p>

                            <p>White chocolate is easy to identify because of its cream or ivory color. It is made by
                                combining sugar, cocoa butter, milk, vanilla, and lecithin (an emulsifier that helps the
                                ingredients blend together). These ingredients give white chocolate its sweet vanilla
                                aroma. White chocolate often has a flavor profile that can be described as predominately
                                sweet, with bold notes of sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Good quality white
                                chocolate will have a rich, soft, and creamy texture — a characteristic that comes from
                                its cocoa butter base and high sugar and milk content.

                                White chocolate is unique because it does not contain any cocoa solids. The cocoa solids
                                are what give chocolate it’s dark brown color and chocolatey taste that we all know and
                                love. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets standards of classification for
                                each kind of chocolate. According to their definition, in order for something to be
                                considered white chocolate it must contain at least 20% cocoa butter and 14% milk, and
                                no more than 55% sugar.

                                Many ask, “Is white chocolate, chocolate?” The answer is yes because it contains
                                ingredients from the cacao bean. Not to be confused with the white-flavored or
                                vanilla-flavored coating that is often found in sub-par products. Cocoa butter is
                                expensive because it is in high demand by the cosmetics industry, for use in lotions and
                                other beauty products. Therefore, companies often create a compound that substitutes
                                other vegetable fats in place of the cocoa butter. These white chocolate-like
                                substitutes can’t be officially called white chocolate because they often don’t meet the
                                20% cocoa butter requirement set by the FDA definition.

                                White chocolate, when stored properly, has a shelf life of about four months. While it
                                is delicious to eat, white chocolate is also great for cooking, baking, and decorating.
                                The dairy-forward flavor profile adds subtle richness to any dish, while still letting
                                other flavors shine through. White chocolate’s color lends itself well to decorating
                                cookies, cakes, and confections. If it’s your first time cooking with white chocolate,

                            <p>Milk chocolate is a classic that we all know and love from childhood. With its light
                                brown color, creamy texture, and sweet flavor, milk chocolate is widely regarded as the
                                most popular type of chocolate. It is made by combining chocolate liquor (cocoa solids
                                and cocoa butter) with sugar, and milk. Sometimes an emulsifier, such as soy lecithin,
                                is added to enhance its smoothness. According to the FDA definition, milk chocolate must
                                contain at least 10% chocolate liquor and 12% milk.

                                Break off a piece of milk chocolate and let the aroma fill the air. Enjoy the smell of
                                caramelized sugar, vanilla, chocolate, and dairy. Then take a bite and let the flavor
                                fill your mouth. Milk chocolate often has a flavor profile that can be described as
                                sweet and chocolatey, with notes of cooked milk and caramelized sugar and a vanilla
                                aftertaste.

                                Milk chocolate is considered to be a good middle of the road chocolate. It is
                                characteristically sweeter, with a softer texture than dark chocolate, but not quite as
                                sweet and soft as white chocolate. When properly stored, milk chocolate has a shelf-life
                                of about 16 months. Milk chocolate is a great choice for when you want a treat or
                                chocolate gift everyone will enjoy. It can be used in baking when your recipe requires a
                                milder chocolate flavor, we suggest trying it in these chocolate waffles.</p>

                            <p> Ruby chocolate is a style or distinct variety of chocolate that is pink or purple in
                                colour. Barry Callebaut, a Belgian–Swiss cocoa company, introduced it as a distinct
                                product on 5 September 2017 after beginning development of their product in
                                2004.[2][3][4] It has a pink color, and Barry Callebaut says it is a fourth natural type
                                of chocolate (in addition to dark, milk, and white chocolate varieties).[5][6] Some
                                other industry experts have said that some cacao pods are naturally pink or purple in
                                colour, and thus pink chocolate has been available before.</p>
